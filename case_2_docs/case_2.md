# Case 2: Ingesting Code Findings into a Data Warehouse

For this case, we would like you to treat this as an actual question you've received from a customer. Take us into your thought process for resolving the issue and communicating a solution back to the customer.

## Challenge

### Customer Question

"I don't see an option to download all the code findings from the Semgrep UI. I want to ingest all the code findings from all our repos since January 1, 2024 into a data warehouse. Can you please help me with a script to fetch them? We prefer the findings in a JSON format for easier processing and analysis."

### Deliverables

1. **Script Development**: Create a script using the Semgrep API to fetch all code findings since January 1, 2024.
   - Use any scripting language of your choice.
   - Use the same Semgrep account created for the tech screen and generate an authorization token for API access.
   - Focus on basic functionality; complex error handling can be skipped.
   - Output all findings in a JSON file.

2. **Customer Response**: Write a response to the customer explaining:
   - How to use the script
   - Any required setup or configuration

3. **Approach Explanation**: Separately, explain:
   - Your approach to creating the script
   - Next steps if you receive the same request from multiple customers
