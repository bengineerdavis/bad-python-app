# Response to Customer: Exporting Semgrep Findings

**Subject:** Re: Exporting Code Findings from Semgrep UI

Dear [Customer's Name],

Thank you for reaching out to Semgrep Support. I understand you're looking to export all code findings from your repositories since January 1, 2024, for ingestion into your data warehouse. I'm happy to help with this request.

## Solution

I've prepared a Python script that will fetch all findings from your Semgrep organization and save them in a structured JSON format. This script uses Semgrep's API to retrieve the data you need.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- `requests` library (can be installed via pip)
- Semgrep API token with appropriate permissions

### Quick Start

1. **Install the required dependency**:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

2. **Set your API token** (replace with your actual token):
   ```bash
   export SEMGREP_API_TOKEN='your-api-token-here'
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python fetch_semgrep_findings.py
   ```

The script will create a file named `semgrep_findings.json` containing all findings since January 1, 2024.

## Output Format

The JSON output includes comprehensive information about each finding, including:
- Repository details
- Rule information (ID, message, severity, confidence)
- File path and line numbers
- Code snippets
- Timestamps
- And more

## Customization

You can modify the following in the script if needed:
- Change the start date by modifying the `START_DATE` variable
- Adjust the output filename by changing the `OUTPUT_FILE` variable
- Add pagination or filtering as needed

## Next Steps

1. Review the generated JSON file to ensure it meets your requirements
2. Import the data into your data warehouse using your preferred ETL tool
3. Consider scheduling this script to run periodically for continuous data collection

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions about the script, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help!
